The Sun's gravity is what keeps the Solar System together, including Earth and the other planets.
It has a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers (about 864,000 miles).
The Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old and is expected to continue its current phase for another 5 billion years.
It emits light and heat, which are essential for life on Earth.
The Sun's surface temperature is about 5,500°C (9,932°F).
Its core temperature reaches around 15 million°C (27 million°F).
The Sun's energy is generated through the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium.

Mercury’s extremely thin atmosphere means that surface temperatures can vary wildly.
The planet has a heavily cratered surface, much like Earth's Moon.
One day on Mercury lasts about 59 Earth days.
Mercury has no moons or rings.
It takes 88 Earth days for Mercury to complete an orbit around the Sun.
The planet’s proximity to the Sun makes it hard to explore with spacecraft.
It’s named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury.
Mercury experiences extreme temperatures, from very hot to freezing.` },
            { name: 'Venus', radius: 0.8, distance: 8, color: 0xffcc00, description: `Venus is often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size and composition.
However, its thick atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect.
Surface temperatures on Venus can reach 900°F (475°C).
Venus has clouds of sulfuric acid and an atmosphere mostly of carbon dioxide.
One day on Venus is longer than a year, taking 243 Earth days to rotate.
It rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, known as retrograde rotation.
Venus has no moons or rings.
The planet’s surface features mountains, valleys, and vast plains.
Venus is the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon.
It’s named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.` },

It’s the only planet known to support life.
Earth has a diverse climate system, including deserts, oceans, forests, and polar ice caps.
About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered with water.
Earth’s atmosphere protects life from the Sun's harmful radiation.
The planet has a single natural satellite, the Moon.
Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days.
The planet has a powerful magnetic field generated by its molten core.
Earth’s climate is changing due to human activity, leading to global warming.
It’s the densest planet in the Solar System and the fifth-largest.` },
            { name: 'Mars', radius: 0.6, distance: 14, color: 0xff3300, description: `Mars is often called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance.
The red color comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
Mars has the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons.
It also has a massive canyon system, Valles Marineris.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
The planet has seasons, polar ice caps, and weather patterns.
Mars' atmosphere is thin and mostly carbon dioxide.
The planet has been a target for exploration for decades, with rovers and orbiters studying it.
There’s evidence that liquid water may exist beneath its surface.
Mars is named after the Roman god of war.` },

It’s primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun.
Jupiter’s atmosphere features giant storms, including the Great Red Spot.
The planet has a strong magnetic field, over 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.
Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
The planet also has a faint ring system.
Jupiter’s fast rotation causes it to bulge at the equator.
It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Jupiter’s gravity influences many objects in the Solar System.
It’s named after the king of the Roman gods.` },
            { name: 'Saturn', radius: 1.2, distance: 22, color: 0xffcc99, description: `Saturn is the second-largest planet in the Solar System.
It’s known for its spectacular ring system, which is made of ice and rock.
Saturn is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter.
It has 83 known moons, with Titan being the largest and one of the most Earth-like moons.
Saturn’s low density means it would float in water, if there were a body large enough.
Its atmosphere features fast winds and large storms.
The planet takes about 29 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Saturn’s rings are divided into several parts, with gaps like the Cassini Division.
The planet has a unique hexagonal storm at its north pole.
It’s named after the Roman god of agriculture and time.` },
            { name: 'Uranus', radius: 1, distance: 26, color: 0x66ccff, description: `Uranus is an ice giant, with a composition mainly of water, methane, and ammonia.
It has a blue-green color due to the methane in its atmosphere.
Uranus rotates on its side, making it unique among planets.
The planet takes 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
Uranus has 27 known moons and a faint ring system.
Its atmosphere features extreme seasonal changes, with long periods of darkness and light.
Uranus has a very cold atmosphere, with temperatures dropping as low as -224°C.
The planet’s rings are dark and narrow, composed mostly of ice and rock.
It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel.
Uranus is named after the Greek deity of the sky.` },
            { name: 'Neptune', radius: 0.9, distance: 30, color: 0x0000ff, description: `Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun.
It’s known for its striking blue color, due to the presence of methane.
The planet has a dynamic atmosphere with the fastest winds in the Solar System.
Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest.
It has a faint and incomplete ring system.
The planet takes about 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Neptune was discovered in 1846 based on mathematical predictions.
Its atmosphere contains the Great Dark Spot, a storm similar to Jupiter’s Red Spot.
The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea.` }
